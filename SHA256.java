// Java SHA-256

// Secure Hash Algorithm 2 (SHA-2) is a set of crytograhic hash functions designed by the national security Agency (NSN). It consist of six identical hashing algorithms (i.e., SHA-256, SHA-512, SHA-224, SHA-384, SHA-512/224, SHA-512/256) with a variable digest size. SHA-256 is a 256-bit (32 byte) hashing algorithm which can calculate a hash code for an input of up to 264-1 bits. It undergoes 64 rounds of hashing and calculates a hash code that is a 64-digit hexiadecimal number. 

// Given a string s, print its SHA-256 hash value.

// Input: s = "HelloWorld"
// Output: 872e4e50ce9990d8b041330c47c9ddd11bec6b503ae9386a99da8584e9bb12c4
